Hello! I'm Michael.

<br/>

I made **yaplet** as a *twitter*-esque personal scratchpad -- a place to think out loud and share my progress in public.

- no algorithms, no engagement chasing
- not a social network, more like my personal public notebook
- raw unpolished thoughts

<br/>

That's it!
Feel free to [fork](https://www.github.com/mmfallacy/yaplet) and start your own yaplet!

> <small> Made via Lovable and Opencode with SvelteKit </small>
