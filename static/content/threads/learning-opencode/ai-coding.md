AI assisted coding has been an up and coming trend within the development space the past few years. IDEs like Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro Code, Antigravity are now part of the common tools a typical developer uses.

Honestly, relying on AI tools feels like cheating to me. But for the past few weeks now, I've been exploring agentic coding plugins and tools like [codecompanion.nvim](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev/), [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). These tools were fine, but after trying [opencode](https://opencode.ai/), it was more well suited with my workflow than the other two.
